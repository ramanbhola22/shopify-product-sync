  description: In order to react in real time primarily for excise tax
  calculations, Token of Trust needs to have product information on hand. To help
  facilitate integrations of that product information weâ€™ve developed an API to
  allow product master data source systems to push that product information to Token of Trust so that transactions can be handled quickly. We currently only
  support vape products but others may be supported soon.
